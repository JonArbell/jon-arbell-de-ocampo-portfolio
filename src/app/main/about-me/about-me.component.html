                <p class="xxs:mb-2 3xl:mb-0">I still remember the first time I wrote a program that actually worked. It was a simple C++ script, but the excitement of solving a problem through code was unforgettable. That moment sparked my journey of continuous learning—from writing basic programs to developing scalable applications with Spring Boot. Now, every challenge I encounter is another opportunity to grow. Coding isn't just a skill to me — it's a mindset.</p>

                <p class="xxs:mb-2 3xl:mb-0">Every bug is a puzzle, and every system issue is a challenge waiting to be solved. As a backend developer, I've learned that the best solutions aren't always the easiest ones—they're the ones that scale, perform, and stand the test of time. My approach to coding is simple: write clean, maintainable, and efficient solutions that make an impact.</p>
