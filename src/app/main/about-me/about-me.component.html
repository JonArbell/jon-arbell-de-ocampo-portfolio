                <hr class="border-0 h-[1px] bg-orange-700">

                <p>I still remember the first time I wrote a program that actually worked. It was a small script, but the feeling of solving a problem through code was exhilarating. That moment set me on a journey of continuous learning, from struggling with complex algorithms to building scalable applications using Spring Boot. Now, every challenge I face is another opportunity to grow. Coding is more than a skill — it's a mindset.</p>

                <p>Every bug is a puzzle, and every system issue is a challenge waiting to be solved. As a backend developer, I've learned that the best solutions aren't always the easiest ones—they're the ones that scale, perform, and stand the test of time. My approach to coding is simple: write clean, maintainable, and efficient solutions that make an impact.</p>
